## Book Review: Bertrand Russell's 'History of Western Philosophy'

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"History of Western Philosophy" is a book the internet has recommended many times as an entry-point to philosophy. Many will tell you this isn't because it's the most precise or most comprehensive, but because it makes philosophy - a field that's known to laypeople as obtuse and esoteric - easy to view in a broad and accessible way. I'd agree.</p>

As the title suggests, you're looking at an overview of the most important movements and thinkers in the western philosophical tradition - the likes of Plato, Thomas Aquinas and Kant. It's not exactly academic or impartial, but it's written by Sir Bertrand Russell, who is a well-respected and fairly orthodox philosopher. If you really just want to dive into more radical or modern philosophers, or if you're interested in philosophy solely for what can be applied directly to your day to day life (like those modern pseudo-stoics)... not for you! This book is engaging, but it spends a lot of time on philosophers who are historically prominent, but wholly irrelevant today.

<p>The book has a few commonly noted weaknesses, which make it surprising to me it still stands as 'the best introduction' to philosophy. It was published in 1945. That's about 80 years of new work, and new perspectives on old work in philosophy since, that the book doesn't and can't address. Some reviewers also note historical inaccuracy, due to the inevitable outdatedness of the historical picture in the 1940s. </p>

<p>The scope of Russell's vision is limited more or less to Greeks, Romans, Churchmen and modern Europeans - with a brief mention of the Persians - fairly reasonably given the title, and the different natures of western and non-western philosophy.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The book's loosely divided into antiquity (focusing on the Greeks, from the Pre-socratics to Aristotle), the Middle Ages and post-Enlightenment modernity.</p>

<p><br>This view isn't comprehensive though - it's transparently subject to Sir Russell's biases, which leads to several notable thinkers being omitted and some getting much more time and detailed examination than others for not much reason. This book isn't a definitive statement and like any other you'll need to do secondary research to get a full picture. <br>Bertie is a humanist analytical thinker, but he makes his biases clear, and a typical reader will likely agree or sympathise with his views.

Not that Bertie isn't willing to dish out the criticism. This is a necessary part of a history of philosophy, full of figures who often get wrapped up in myth; and to a new student, it's helpful in seeing that there are many perspectives on every important school of thought. Notably, he calls Plato's Socrates dishonest and notes his orphic saint-like nature, in contrast to the common view of Socrates in light of his successors rather than his primitive predecessors. He says Stoicism has a strong element of 'sour grapes'. He condemns Sparta for being a brutal military aristocracy, where Spartan society is sometimes admired even now for it's martial fanaticism. There's a fair bit of this throughout, so stay aware that it's not a complete multi-dimensional appraisal.

<p>The book shows some obvious bias towards philosophers in the modern era - Russell retains an aloof tone but obviously hasn't inhabited and really considered the philosophical worlds of Nietzsche (then more strongly associated with Nazism than he is now, and considered part of the romantic lineage of philosophy which Russell disdains) and Marx (who Russell judges as motivated by hate, and whose philosophy Russell doesn't explain in detail).</p>

<p>As long as you keep these points in mind, it's a fascinating read. I'm not ready to credit Russell entirely on this, because the subject matter is inherently compelling - a history of ideas. I think what Russell does right is to make clear the connection between different ideas across time periods and even into our own. Retaining the human element of the<br>thinkers and societies he talks about goes a long way to making the subject matter feel relevant to the psychology of modern movements - where otherwise they might be only aesthetically or anecdotally interesting to the layman.</p>

<p>Russell's writing is clear and usually good. He's a solid writer. He's got a bit of snark and likes pointing out inconsistencies as much as everyone else. It's not horribly dry, but he tries to keep up an appearance, or at least a dignified air, of impartiality.</p>

<p>My largest criticism isn't in the minutiae of his writing, but rather in what he chooses to cover. Aside from the inconsistency of who he covers, he isn't consistent in what degree of detail he treats each philosopher's personal life.<br>He sometimes avoids going into detail on a philosopher's important ideas, but in other cases goes into lengthy description of outdated metaphysical concepts that, while historically important, don't seem all that relevant.</p>

<p>I enjoyed it greatly. I think there are probably other books worth reading before this one, but it's decently entertaining and does a great job introducing a broad view. If you're new to philosophy and want a bit of context, want to wet your feet<br>before you jump into whichever ideas most intrigue you - this isn't a bad place to start. It is around 900 pages long, so it's not a quick read.</p>

<p>Hope that helps. Enjoy ! :)</p>
