## Book Review: Bertrand Russell's 'History of Western Philosophy'

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"History of Western Philosophy" is a book the internet has recommended many times as an entry-point to philosophy. Many will tell you this isn't because it's the most precise or most comprehensive, but because it makes philosophy - a field that's known to laypeople as obtuse and esoteric - easy to view in a broad and accessible way. I'd agree.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The book has a few commonly noted weaknesses, which make it surprising to me it still stands as 'the best introduction' to philosophy. It was published in 1945. That's about 80 years of new work, and new perspectives on old work in philosophy since, that the book doesn't and can't address. </p>

<p>Some reviewers have also noted some historical information is also out-of-date given the less developed dating and investigative methods of the 1940s, but I can't credibly comment on that.</p>

<p>The scope of Russell's vision is limited more or less to Greeks, Romans, Churchmen and modern Europeans - with a brief mention of the Persians - fairly reasonably given the title, and the different natures of western and non-western philosophy.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The book's loosely divided into antiquity (focusing on the Greeks, from the Pre-socratics to Aristotle), the Middle Ages and post-Enlightenment modernity.</p>

<p><br>This view isn't comprehensive though - it's transparently subject to Sir Russell's biases, which leads to several notable thinkers being omitted and some getting much more time and detailed examination than others for not much reason. This book isn't a definitive statement and like any other you'll need to do secondary research to get a full picture. <br>Bertie is a humanist analytical thinker, but he makes his biases clear. They don't become overbearing until the last few hundred pages, and even then an orthodox modern reader wouldn't take issue with any of his stances - except possibly that he's a little too harsh on Marxism or Romanticism, depending on your political leanings.</p>

<p>The book shows some obvious bias towards philosophers in the modern era - Russell retains an aloof tone but obviously hasn't inhabited and really considered the philosophical worlds of Nietzsche (then more strongly associated with Nazism then he is now, and considered part of the romantic lineage of philosophy which Russell disdains) and Marx (who Russell judges as motivated by hate, and whose philosophy Russell doesn't explain in detail), for two examples.</p>

<p>As long as you keep these points in mind, it's a fascinating read. I'm not ready to credit Russell entirely on this, because the subject matter is inherently compelling - a history of ideas. I think what Russell does right is to make clear the connection between different ideas across time periods and even into our own. Retaining the human element of the<br>thinkers and societies he talks about goes a long way to making the subject matter feel relevant to the psychology of modern movements - where otherwise they might be only aesthetically or anecdotally interesting to the layman.</p>

<p>Russell's writing is clear and usually good. He's a solid writer. He's got a bit of snark and likes pointing out inconsistencies as much as everyone else. It's not horribly dry, but he tries to keep up an appearance, or at least a dignified air, of impartiality.</p>

<p>My largest criticism isn't in the minutiae of his writing, but rather in what he chooses to cover. Aside from the inconsistency of who he covers, he isn't consistent in what degree of detail he treats each philosopher's personal life.<br>He sometimes avoids going into detail on a philosopher's important ideas, but in other cases goes into lengthy description of outdated metaphysical concepts that, while historically important, don't seem all that relevant.</p>

<p>I enjoyed it greatly. I think there are probably other books worth reading before this one, but it's decently entertaining and does a great job introducing a broad view. If you're new to philosophy and want a bit of context, want to wet your feet<br>before you jump into whichever ideas most intrigue you - this isn't a bad place to start. It is around 900 pages long, so it's not a quick read.</p>
